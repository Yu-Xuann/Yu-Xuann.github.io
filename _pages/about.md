# Welcome!

Hi, I am **Yuxuan Jiang(蒋宇轩)**.  
I obtained my B.Sc. in **Electronic Science and Technology** from the **Chien-Shiung Wu College, Southeast University**.  

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on:
- **Electromagnetic metamaterials**, including metasurfaces for dynamic beamforming.  
- **Artificial intelligence for image processing**, focusing on computer vision techniques.  

I am now applying to pursue graduate studies, with a focus on **integrated circuits (IC design)**.
