Hi, I am **Yuxuan Jiang (蒋宇轩)** 

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the **Chien-Shiung Wu College, Southeast University**, majoring in **Electronic Science and Technology**.  

During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on:  
- **Electromagnetic metamaterials**, including metasurfaces for dynamic beamforming.  
- **Artificial intelligence for image processing**, focusing on computer vision techniques.  

I am now applying to pursue graduate studies, with a research focus on **integrated circuits (IC design)**.
